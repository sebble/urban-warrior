# Urban Warrior
Fitness is going Open-Source! Urban Warrior is a project whose initial outcome is to collaboratively produce a fitness manual for those looking to venture into bodyweight strength training. We're actively looking for involvement from the community to contribute to this project and give everyone the information they need to become healthier and stronger!
