# Urban Warrior
Fitness is going Open-Source! Urban Warrior is a project whose initial outcome is to collaboratively produce a fitness manual for those looking to venture into bodyweight strength training. We're actively looking for involvement from the community to contribute to this project and give everyone the information they need to become healthier and stronger!

# How Contribute
Urban Warrior is seeking to be a high-quality fitness manual that not only imparts professional-grade fitness information, but does so with clarity and illustration. We also seek to lower what we call the 'barrier to strength' for most - generally thought by us to be investments in cognition (thinking), money, time, and equipment.

It should also be noted that Urban Warrior focuses on Calisthenics and Bodyweight exercises, and in particular Street Workout and Home Workout. Whilst not strictly anti-weights (although definitely anti-machine) we're not currently seeking contributions regarding any of the weightlifting disciplines (maybe fork the project for a weights manual?).

We are particularly seeking contributions in the following areas:

 - Written Content. Exercise tutorials, nutrition advice, training tips, more! Did you make your own equipment? What do you do when you find yourself without a pull-up bar? What do you wear when training? All of these
 - Photography. Again of the exercises. Photography can be of varying standards to begin with but as the project progresses we'll seek higher quality photos. Photography must be released under the GPL v3.0 as part of this project.
 - Diagrams. Of exercises, muscles etc. Whatever the content dictates.
 - Typesetting or Publication formatting. We're gonna be writing this and typesetting this in separate branches and try to make this look as lovely as possible.

Urban Warrior will evolve over time. What it evolves into, we cannot yet say. All who contribute will be contributing a little bit of themselves, and a philosophy will emerge; an approach or mindset to doing things. We believe that this can only be a good thing as long as it is not actively harmful to those who take part (such as enforcing destructive training methods).

## What you'll need to contribute
At the project current stage (initial), the development of the manual is divided into distinct branches, and you'll need different tools to work on each branch.
1. **content** - containing text and image files that will be processed into the manual.
2. **typeset** - typeset versions of the text and image that will produce the initial manuscripts for the manual.

We expect this not to be sufficient to run the entire project from start to finish; more branches *will* be added as and when the project becomes complex enough to warrant a sustainable infrastructure, and we work out exactly what that means for this project. At present you need one or more of the following tools to contribute to the manual itself.
 - Git version control system, for contributing to the project. http://www.git-scm.com
 - For working on **content**, an office suite capable of producing OpenDocument Format text files (.odt). We recommend http://libreoffice.org
 - If you're looking to **typeset**, then we're currently using PDFLaTeX. You'll need this. http://www.latex-project.org/

 We're also looking into moving to Gitbook to make contributing easier! Once this is done, this README will be changed appropriately.
